<h1>About</h1>
<p>
  This page was set up using the
  <a href="http://www.railstutorial.org/book">Rails Tutorial book</a> and
  <a href="http://screencasts.railstutorial.org/">screencast series</a>
  to teach web development with
  <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/">Ruby on Rails</a>.
  I've made modifications from the tutorial to make this more of a resume
  styled blog. I'll mainly be posting further developments with my programming
  projects and probably music projects as well.
